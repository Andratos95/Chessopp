Chessopp is a software that can be used to study openings and practice them with spaced repetition.

It can be founf at this URL: https://andratos95.github.io/Chessopp/

It is currently optimized for usage with a mouse, as it uses drag and drop functionality to move pieces.
The program is subdivided in 3 tabs: Editor, Library and Practice.

The Editor tab is used to input an opening tree and its variations. Each variation can be annotated, by typing a comment in the field below the tree variation panel, and selecting "Save Note".
The user can also select the opening to be analysed by the free chess engine Stockfish 10, rated about 3400 ELO. 
The user can navigate the main line variation with the arrow keys on the keyboard, or by clicking the next move in the tree variation panel. Once an opening tree has been generated, it can be exported as a .json file for future usage within Chessopp.

The user can also store an opening in the Library tab, by selecting a name for the opening and clicking "Save New". This should be saved in the browser memory and be available the next time that the user opens the browser.
The opening can then be loaded by clicking on it in the library tab, and this will subtitute the opening in the editor tab (therefore the user should be careful to make sure the previous variations in the editor were saved as a new opening, or updated to an existing opening, or everything will be lost when loading another opening).
A previously saved .json file opening can also be loaded. The saved opening list can be ordered with the up and down arrows next to the opening name in the library panel.

The Practice tab can be used to practice the saved openings in the library, either as white or black. The user will be given a random permutation of the lines saved within the opening that they will be able to practice. 
The previously saved comments (i.e. notes) can be shown by the "Show Comments" toggle switch. The hint button allows the user to see what piece has to be moved for the next line, while the "Show Solution" allows the user to see the next move in the sequence. 
The "Retry Last Line" button allows the user to practice again the previous line. A progress status is shown on top. At any moment the user can decide to restart the practice from zero with the "Start Over" button, or go back to the initial practice screen with the "Quit" button.

I hope you enjoy my simple software and that it will help you get better at chess!

Best,
